what happen after logout into passport js
// Yes, you're correct. req.logout() is a function provided by Passport.js that removes the user's details from the session, effectively logging the user out.

// When req.logout() is called:

// Passport.js removes the user's details from the session store.
// Subsequent requests from the user will not be recognized as authenticated because their details are no longer stored in the session.
// This function essentially clears the user's authentication state, forcing them to log in again to access protected resources.


Q--but how logout  to get user session id which one store into store:---
If you want to access the user's session ID stored in the session store during the logout process, you typically don't need to do so because `req.logout()` provided by Passport.js abstracts away these details for you. 

However, if you have specific requirements where you need to access the session ID for some reason during logout, you would need to use the session middleware directly. The exact method for accessing the session ID may depend on the session store you are using, as different session stores may have different APIs.

Here's a general example of how you might access the session ID using the `express-session` middleware:

```javascript
app.get('/logout', function(req, res){
  const sessionId = req.sessionID; // Accessing the session ID
  req.logout(); // Terminates the user's session
  res.redirect('/login');
});
```

In this example, `req.sessionID` is used to access the session ID associated with the current request. After accessing the session ID, `req.logout()` is called to terminate the user's session, and then the user is redirected to the login page.

Please note that accessing the session ID directly like this is rarely necessary for typical logout operations, as Passport.js abstracts away these details for you. However, if you have specific requirements where you need to access the session ID, you can do so using the method provided by the session middleware you're using in your application.
