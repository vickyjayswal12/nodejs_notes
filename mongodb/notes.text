Q-in mongodb monggose model create collection



In MongoDB, Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js. Mongoose provides a straightforward schema-based solution to model your application data.

When you define a Mongoose model, it does not directly create a collection in MongoDB. Instead, Mongoose implicitly creates a collection based on the model name you specify when you define it.

Here's how you can define a Mongoose model and perform operations on it, which indirectly leads to the creation of a collection:

1. **Define a Mongoose Schema**: First, you define a Mongoose schema, which represents the structure of documents within a collection.

```javascript
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

// Define a Mongoose schema
const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
    name: String,
    email: String,
    age: Number
});

// Create a Mongoose model based on the schema
const User = mongoose.model('User', userSchema);
```

2. **Perform Operations on the Model**: Once you've defined the schema and model, you can perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using the model.

```javascript
// Connect to MongoDB (assuming you've set up your MongoDB connection)
mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost:27017/my_database', { useNewUrlParser: true, useUnifiedTopology: true });

// Create a new document
const newUser = new User({
    name: 'John Doe',
    email: 'john@example.com',
    age: 30
});

// Save the document to the database
newUser.save((err, user) => {
    if (err) {
        console.error(err);
    } else {
        console.log('User saved successfully:', user);
    }
});
```

When you perform operations using the `User` model, Mongoose implicitly creates a collection named "users" (lowercase and pluralized version of the model name "User" by default). If you want to specify a custom collection name, you can do so when defining the model:

```javascript
const User = mongoose.model('User', userSchema, 'my_custom_collection');
```

In this case, Mongoose will use the collection named "my_custom_collection" instead.

So, while Mongoose doesn't explicitly create collections, it manages the interaction with MongoDB on your behalf, and collections are created as you interact with the defined models.
