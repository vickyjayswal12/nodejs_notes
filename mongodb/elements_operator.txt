element operator used to any condition ralated to fild(element) 
it is used check precondition like if field is exits than do operations ,and first check field type and field array length
methods :-- 
$exists:--
syntax: {field:{$exists:<boolean>}}
this will use this field exits or not
exm:- find documents in which price field is exists
db.products.find({price:{$exists:true}})

if not exits than
db.products.find({price:{$exists:false}})

exm2: find documents in which price field is exists and price greater than 20
db.products.find({price:{$exists:true},price:{$gt:20}})


$type:-
syntax: {field:{$type:<bson-data-type>}}


exm: find if price is number
db.products.find({price:{$type:'number'}})




$size:--
is use in document any field's value in array than this will use to find that length
syntax:{field:{$size:<array-length>}}

$size operator typically returns the number of elements in an array or the number of characters in a string. Here's a brief example of how it can be used in MongoDB's query language, which supports the $size operator:

Suppose you have a collection called products with documents structured like this:
{ "_id": 1, "name": "Product 1", "tags": ["electronics", "gadgets"] }
{ "_id": 2, "name": "Product 2", "tags": ["electronics", "accessories", "cables"] }
{ "_id": 3, "name": "Product 3", "tags": ["clothing", "accessories"] }

Now, let's say you want to find all documents where the tags array has exactly two elements. You can use the $size operator for this
db.products.find({ tags: { $size: 2 } })
